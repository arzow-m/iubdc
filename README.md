#  SF Inter-University Big Data Challenge (IUBDC) Program
This project leverages machine learning to predict adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in elderly patients, a critical issue given that nearly 40% of seniors are on five or more medications. Using the MIMIC-4 dataset with over 400,000 emergency department records, we identified key features such as number of medications, procedures, age, and gender that contribute to ADR risk. Our model helps flag high-risk patients early, allowing healthcare providers to intervene before serious harm occurs. This repository includes scripts and tools designed for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization.

Grading Criteria: Judges will evaluate your presentation based on how effectively you can deliver a clear, passionate, and impactful three-minute talk that explains complex research 
in a way that a non-specialist audience can easily understand.

We were awarded 3rd place among 40 teams! This program was open to anyone including upper years and graduate students, so this was an incredibly important milestone for me :)
