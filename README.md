#  SF Inter-University Big Data Challenge (IUBDC) Program
The global rise in the elderly population is putting an increasing strain on healthcare systems, particularly due to the increased chance of chronic illness, polypharmacy, and healthcare utilization. The traditional one-size-fits-all treatment approach often fails to address the unique and evolving needs of older adults, leading to adverse drug reactions, diminished quality of life, and inefficient use of medical resources. This study investigated the potential of personalized medicine — augmented by artificial intelligence (AI) — to improve elderly care through data-driven, individualized treatment plans. By integrating data from electronic health records, genomics, wearable devices, and lifestyle factors, we developed AI-enhanced models capable of tailoring treatments to each patient’s specific profile. These models allow for real-time treatment adjustments, predictive risk assessments, and optimized drug regimens. Our findings suggest that AI-driven personalized care can reduce adverse outcomes, enhance clinical effectiveness, and support proactive, scalable, and patient-centered healthcare for aging populations.

This project focuses on the analysis and processing of the **MIMIC-IV** dataset to derive insights. It includes scripts and tools designed for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization. The primary goal is to explore patterns and relationships within the data to aid in detecting ADR in elderly patients before it occurs.
