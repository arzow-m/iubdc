This project focuses on the analysis and processing of the **MIMIC-IV** dataset to derive insights. It includes scripts and tools designed for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization. The primary goal is to explore patterns and relationships within the data to aid in detecting ADR in elderly patients before it occurs.

Please note that due to HIPAA privacy rules and the sensitive nature of health information, actual patient data is not included in this repository. All datasets used for development and demonstration purposes are not shared in this public repository.
